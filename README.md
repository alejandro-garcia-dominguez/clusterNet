#clusterNet is a FREE cluster framework for develop java cluster applications.

#Description
clusterNet is initialy based on a novel reliable multicast transport protocol (level 4 of the OSI stack) developed at Universidad de Sevilla. Has been implemented with a herarchical design based on local groups that help minimizing control flow and permit the grow of the numbers of participants to a high level

clusterNet provide a usefull framework to easy develop cluster applications. 
clsuterNet is been used to implement a Scada Multicast Cluster for SmartGrids. At present testing developments are using IEC 60870-5-104 protocol and IEC 61850.

#Tools - Examples
cFtp - a ftp cluster tool 

cChat - a chat cluster tool

cPingSender / cPingReceiver Added mutils. A simple ping tool for send and receive multicast packets to test multicast communications on your cluster network. 

#Licence
clusterNet use licence Apache 2.0. Work is in progress.
